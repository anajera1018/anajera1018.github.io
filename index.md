### Favorite CPSC 120l Labs

###### * Lab 10, Part 1

###### Lab 10, part 1 was one of my favorites because I got to work independtly over the break. This lab organizes the population data of California counties that is easy to understand. It can give you the population and percentage of any county in the state. The program uses test for verification, vector for storing data, and functions for processing. 

###### * Lab 11, Part 1

###### Lab 11, part 1 was also one of my favorite labs because it challenging but it was one of the few I able to get done 100%. I was able to create a list of states in the U.S. and calculate how crowded each one is. Data was used from their names, populations, and land areas. After finding the most and least crowded states, it printed out the name of those states.

###### * Lab 12, Part 1

###### Finally Lab 12, part 1 was the most challenging with the most interesting output. It was unique and colorful. This code made a colorful animated GIF that looks like a moving gradient. It mixes red, green, and blue (RGB) to create the altering colors in images based on the brightness. The program created 10 pictures, slightly shifting colors each time, to make an animation that looks like it loops forever.
